                        <li>My name is Pham Vo Dong and my student number is s3891968. You can contact me on the main email phamvodong0811@gmail.com or the optional email s3891968@rmit.edu.vn. I am a motivated Vietnamese student who can learn and receive new information using logical thinking. I graduated from high school in Vietnam with a 4.0 GPA, and mathematics and physics are my best subjects.
                             I began learning English in sixth grade and am now fluent in both Vietnamese and English.
                              Since grade 11, I've been studying information technology and competing in robotics competitions. 
                              For the time being, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, and in my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball and taking photographs.
                               And the main reason why I choose to spend my time in IT is that in the current era, information technology plays an essential role in our lives, directly affecting personal daily activities that no one can ignore.
                                In my opinion, the advancement of information technology makes a person's life better and more convenient. IT, for example, makes it easier for people to weather the storm of COVID-19 without difficulty because they can do everything online, which does not require face-to-face contact, such as shopping online, studying online, and working from home. Since I was a child, I've had a strong interest in technology. 
                                When my family got their first computer, I was introduced to a new world where I expanded my knowledge of technology. As a result, it piqued my interest. Through my high school robotics club, I decided to participate in some competitions and make some small projects, such as automatic watering systems, light bulbs, and balance cars. In addition, I have worked as a graphic designer since I was in high school and I know Python, HTML.
                                 Therefore, I expect to learn the skills necessary to manage an IT project and bring my fantastic idea to fruition after finishing my studies. </li>
