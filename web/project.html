                <h3 style="font-size: 36px;">About the project</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">This project will create a new version of an ergonomic chair that incorporates artificial intelligence to address various bone problems. It is not only for those who have always been in their chairs for extended periods, but it is also for youngsters to minimize the risk of scoliosis.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 24px;">People in the Covid-19 period must work from home. Some firms are moving from the typical working office to working online, and utilizing seats that appear to be dependable coworkers, they are enhancing the efficiency of online workers. Scoliosis affects around six to nine million persons in the United States, accounting for about 2-3 percent of the population, according to the American Academy of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). Furthermore, according to the same source, the primary age of onset for scoliosis is 10-15 years old, and it affects both genders equally. The number of persons with scoliosis is growing every day, and the average age of scoliosis patients is getting younger. It is a dangerous statistic for people's health, especially for youngsters, who need the most protection for their growth and development. As a result, the AI Ergonomic Chair project was designed to solve this problem and safeguard people's spines.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Because of the advantages of ergonomic seats, they are becoming increasingly popular among office employees and those with a home computer setup. Ergonomics are helpful because of the unique construction. First and foremost, the ergonomic chair provides total back support, which, thanks to the chair's flexing form, helps preserve your spine. Second, sitting with a weird spine is tough since individuals always slump forward when they sit due to gravity. Finally, the seat cushion may be adjusted to maintain a bit backward inclination that supports the spine close to the chair's back. Third, customers may customize their chairs to fit their unique personalities and body shapes by adding or removing additional items. Finally, the chair's fabric is net, which allows it to absorb sweat better than traditional canvas chair fabrics. Because individuals sit on the chair for long periods, much lather is produced. Furthermore, the canvas material absorbs sweat, allowing bacteria associated with venereal illnesses to proliferate. Consequently, the ergonomic chair provides better comfort to those who sit in it, lowers the risk of becoming sick from the spine or skin, and boosts productivity.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 24px;">And the AI will make this chair more comfortable by employing the AI's intelligence, which will automatically modify the chair to the customer's tastes and needs. AI technology will be used in two ways: to scan the body and perform operations in the chair. First, the AI will utilize the sensor to check the user's body form and calculate each individual's best-suited chair design. Artificial intelligence, for example, will adapt a chair to have a long back and a large seat if a person has a long back and a wide waist. Furthermore, artificial intelligence will automatically learn the user's sitting form and adjust the chair's look. Consider someone seated with their legs crossed on the seat cushion; artificial intelligence will extend or build a little flat in the middle of the leg chair so that people may rest their feet on it. The chair's AI will then adjust to their body shape to guarantee that their back is constantly covered by the chair back, as individuals who work for extended periods tend to vary their physical look and their seating performance at different times. Furthermore, because of flexible coupling with the chair, the chair automatically alters its shape to meet the activity being done, such as typing, which demands a weird chair, reading, which necessitates a soft chair akin to a couch, and gaming, among other things. Similar to Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa, this AI will also give visual aid. Individuals may open and command it by using simple instructions like sliding up and down the seat cushion or playing music. This chair will include small speakers on both sides for people who want to rest while listening to music. Furthermore, users may encode their orders into the chair's software, which they can then access from their phones, allowing them to do more complicated operations. Consequently, when artificial intelligence (AI) and an ergonomic chair are integrated, the chair becomes smarter. Furthermore, it is better equipped to adjust to each customer's position, ensuring better protection against sickness.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 24px;">If this initiative succeeds, the number of people who suffer from spine-related ailments, including scoliosis, poor blood circulation, and venereal infections, would decrease. Parents and children are unconcerned about their children's sitting positions, supporting everyone's optimum physical health. This chair has the potential to promote productivity by assisting people in relaxing and decreasing their body weight as they get older, allowing them to better and advance more swiftly in their jobs.

                    <p style="font-size: 24px;">We will collaborate with D’ERGO company to make a chair and use a 3D scanning machine from Scantech 3D Vietnam named GOM SCAN 1 for identifying the customer’s shape. Moreover, our team will create an AI bot with the Microsoft Azure AI Platform, which uses python language and machine learning.</p>
