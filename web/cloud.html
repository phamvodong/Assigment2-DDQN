                <h3 style="font-size: 36px;">What does it do?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">Cloud computing – an IT concept was promoted in recent years. Although it isn't considered an invention, cloud services have been growing and benefit users. Therefore, cloud technology has created a new revolution regarding providing information and assistance to organizations.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">Cloud computing can be considered a comprehensive solution. It transforms information technology into a service. Cloud technology provides solutions to office storage with the remote database where resources are shared like electricity is distributed over the electricity network. It can be stated that cloud computing is a service since it is the distribution of IT resources as demand from users with a payment policy according to usage. Although enterprises like Google or Apple give free cloud storage, they are limited. Before cloud technology, enterprise or individual's storage was mainly physical infrastructure and offline, which led to a significant issue regarding space taken and maintenance. Now, users can access services like cloud computing to backup and retrieve data when needed. The use of cloud databases is the flexibility that makes it easier to use online stored data. For example, websites and applications can easily access and retrieve data remotely, which is very convenient than local storage in the past.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">It is indisputable as regards the benefits of cloud service providers. As mentioned, one of the advantages of the cloud is that it is flexible and instantaneous. The user's cloud database can be accessed anywhere and whenever there's an internet connection on the device. Users can immediately retrieve resources from cloud technology, the Internet of Things, and machine learning. With cloud service, enterprises don't need to support too many resources to do business at the highest level in the future. Instead, an enterprise can pay as much as their growing for the service and storage since cloud computing makes it possible to increase or decrease the warehouse when needed. However, it can only be done on the following period subscription, and the storage size cannot be extended or reduced while the user is on the current subscription.</p>
                <h3 style="font-size: 36px;">What is the likely impact? </h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">     
                The business model has gradually shifted into the IT industry for the last few years, especially in cloud service. Technology will continue to play a critical part in the sector as firms prosper with the help of cloud computing. It is seen in real life since cloud computing is relatively promising in 2020 and 2021 since the impact of Covid – 19. Companies and organizations tend to lean forward with multi-cloud and hybrid cloud solutions to cope with the pandemic because of the company's work-from-home policy. The impact of the pandemic affects the work and results in studying from home as well. Therefore, during the quarantine period, an increase in the use of cloud service where the lecture or learning material is provided online. Not forget to mention that data and the workflow must also be obtained remotely for enterprises and companies. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) report [1], the worldwide spending on cloud service in 2021 is around $700 billion, which is expected to grow up to $1.3 billion in 2025. The largest market segment is Software-as-a-Service which user doesn't need much effort to manage the service since the software provided by the service provider will be updated and fix bugs for the user. The SaaS allows access and contains web or mobile apps, making communication easy between users. There is also an increase in Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). The IaaS contains basic building structures for cloud technology in which it gives access to network features via virtual or physical components and the remote database. It brings out the most flexibility and the ability to control resources on the highest level. Aside from self manually operating, Platform-as-a-Service benefits businesses and individuals from being a self-operating infrastructure allowing users to concentrate on the work.   
                    </p>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">Cloud computing effect on the 4.0 industry is undisputable in which its ability is endless. Since enterprises no longer consider cloud service a tool, it is leveraged to boost business development towards the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform and Hybrid/Multi-cloud strategy. The Hybrid and Multi-cloud services purpose mainly to exchange data and application flow within multiple environments. The service improves the security interface and performance along with flexible capacity and trustworthiness sever, making it valuable for achieving business goals. Another effect of the cloud on business is AI technology, where most prominent tech companies tend to integrate AI into cloud computing to improve the service functionality and customer experience. The usage of AI will make it possible to manage and function automatically, resulting in less maintenance and increased working efficiency. It is also mentionable that the IoT platform with cloud-integrated, which can be used on devices conveniently. The benefits of this are that it is managed automatically and notify the issue to the user in real-time. IoT also provides various industry-grade protocols to make monitor processes efficiently. Although the benefits of cloud computing are undeniable, it also may replace human labour shortly with more minor maintenance requirements. However, it is also an opportunity for new workers to become experts in the field to address business challenges. .</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 36px;">How will this affect you? </h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">The impact of cloud computing on our daily lives is significant in terms of on the move accessibility. Indeed, many may not notice it, but our activity is related to the cloud, and people begin to become too familiar with it. This happens whenever I open my social media and keep checking my acquaintance activity or what is trending, which gradually become my morning routine without notice. I think this is due to the cloud's tremendous effect on the individual since the fear of not knowing the surroundings makes people constantly on the cloud. But the benefits cloud provides to society is undisputable when I don't need to worry about data loss or security. Additionally, regarding my education, I can explore more about cloud services like Microsoft 365, which gave me the experience of doing documents on the cloud. Another cloud service I was taught to use is GitHub. After knowing it, it has become part of my study every time I have a project to work on cloud technologies. GitHub also is used in my school project when I was working on a group assignment. My team mainly used the GitHub repository to store our project. I think it affects since it is easy to keep track of workflow, the project can be viewed in real-time to make editing or viewing and to retrieve.</p><br>
