                <h3 style="font-size: 36px;">What does it do?</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">Many fascinating developments have appeared in the IT World in this day and age, but they cannot achieve some success in recent years. However, some of them have to change and develop in the 4.0 era, especially in the fascinating developments that I want to focus on cybersecurity and privacy. That means I will show what cybersecurity and privacy do and the likely impact, how to affect me in life. 
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">First of all, there is the operation of network security and privacy, which helps many companies of business and national networks to confront attacks from hackers who want to take important information. Cybersecurity has a cyber analyst function, which helps people protect computer networks from cyber-attacks and unauthorized access. That means the cyber analyst has to try to predict and defend against cyber threats and cope with security breaches when those things happen. In this job, people
                have to play a vital role in protecting their organization's valuable data in their company and nation. They show that this new technology's state of the art is complex if people do not avoid unauthorized access or access to dark websites with risky viruses, which destroys intelligence on computers of companies or nations. However, each government has a group or a professional IT person specializing in cybersecurity, which helps their country prevent many threats from attacking the network. For example, in Vietnam, they have Hieu PC, one of the professional IT about cybersecurity that protects the network stay safe. In the next three years, many students will be trained or studied at the university in cybersecurity in technology. They also need to learn the basics of cybersecurity, which they know from industry colleagues experience, which helps them improve their network skills, such as cybersecurity technical skills. That has to use tools like virtual private networks (VPNs), firewalls, antivirus software, and network access control from endpoint management, which helps professors know how to use their phones and computers to protect the network. Besides that, the professor has to use some programming apps to support them in understanding languages such as Javascript, Python and C/C++, which gives them a competitive edge. Along with cybersecurity, workplace skills that bring people to join a communication help them support each other when they work on a team and document the investigation and recovery process. They can see consultation and ideas that help them improve their listening skills. This network security has to link with privacy, which assists people in having to keep private information when they work for companies or national security. Solitude will help people establish boundaries to limit who access the internet in any place, which protects people's information and communication. That means privacy has a rule is when some have deliberately accessed the websites of specific companies or countries, their privacy is violated. The state of the art of aloneness is quite complicated because companies and nations do not know how to keep the confidentiality of their information safe. People have to use essential protection to keep their information private. In the next three years, the thing likely to be done soon is hiring more qualified civilians for privacy positions because companies want to engage people who have experience or have a clear goal or purpose, which means those things help them carry their information. Hence, cybersecurity and privacy are similar in that they both have to protect and secure critical information on the computer.</p>
                     </p>
                <h3 style="font-size: 36px;">What is the likely impact? </h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">When people hear about cybersecurity and privacy, people have to think about things that are likely to have impacts. When hackers access dark websites, people are apprehensive about their information being taken by hackers, but company personnel lack a thing. I mean that different parts of a company lack some people specializing in cybersecurity and privacy, which is a challenge that people have to confront. In the future, many companies are hiring people who have to finish their university or students who practice as students from RMIT University, which is likely to change when the company accepts and adjusts it. Business enterprises are people who will be affected by network security and privacy. For example, when a company runs a business that they have to sell and advertise their product online, competitors could likely steal or alter the sales figures of the better seller, along with giving some malicious viruses for the viral websites. Cybersecurity and privacy will create places for potential people who can show off their skills and knowledge. That means people have a job to do to deal with unemployment, although not many people can try hard for this job in the long-term, study and work in Vietnam. Because there are many codes and complex numbers to remember, along with concentrating when they have to analyse and fix many issues for their computer. Therefore, those things show that cybersecurity and privacy have a positive and negative impact on many jobs in the world who have to use the internet to run businesses online, such as advertising on social media like Facebook, Instagram and the Youtuber, together with online shopping that those new technologies are essential, that will protect their information exclusively before illegal access to websites. Hopefully, cybersecurity and privacy have to make a positive change for many companies in the future.</p>
                <h3 style="font-size: 36px;">How will this affect you? </h3>
                <p style="font-size: 24px;">In my experience, network security and privacy have affected my life in two ways: positive and negative. Things in the world have many aspects that influence people to discuss them. Positively, cybersecurity and privacy are helping my family and my friends control our information to protect profiles on safety. Besides that, we have to know more technical knowledge, especially when looking after the internet, which must be a complicated and completed process of training and studying for experiences. Negatively, we do not know who visits and impacts our information, making us feel uncomfortable. However, this new technology will be making my life change because that motivated me to study information technology at RMIT University, which makes me think that those things have more of a positive influence than the worse ones. In addition, this new technology is essential to companies and organizations and a significant thing to streamers and YouTubers or people who work related to the network. That means this new technology can support them to protect them or use some applications such as antivirus software or firewalls for their computers or phones. Hence, cybersecurity and privacy have changed my life going in a great direction, and I will find a little more knowledge about this industry that can help me in the future. 
                In general, cybersecurity and privacy are a critical technology for people's daily lives; that is the best backup for people's information when they network for work, entertainment, or study for their deadline. However, network security and privacy will be developed if many potential people want to be professors for this job in the future.
