                  Vinh Bui
                  <br>
                  Wow.
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  And, uh, if if like a ANH.
                  This, uh, also include it. If you made the negative aspect as well, but then every aspect is like is, the deadline is not enough or the.
                  Uh, is there any fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh or why it was working OK?
                  <br>

                  Vinh Bui
                  <br>
                  So let's let's talk about the advantages first. OK, so the messages are.
                  I would say.
                  I would say pray every. I was a pretty awesome in terms of.
                  It's a work environment 'cause my coworkers are really friendly and my colleague my colleagues are also willing to help me. When I first came, you know, help. I have friendly and again we catch up with other projects also.
                  No, uh, uhm.
                  Uh, they have a lot of, UM.
                  I guess I have snacks in the pantry and dumb.
                  And.
                  Flexible hours, so basically we don't have to check in and check out every time we we get into a comedy or get out.
                  Uh, most I would say mostly is it based on your.
                  Uh, I think.
                  OK, so mostly stay on your text, but it's never. It's never. I don't think it's it's ever happened that you know an employee discount work before.
                  Also.
                  Uh, on your hand.
                  The disadvantages are seen we, uh, we aren't as sourcing company is pretty hard for us to make a decision.
                  As in most every time the client you know has already made up their mind and we just have forward to follow through with their their decision. So even though sometimes we propose a lot of new ideas to update the features.
                  I ordered them element.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Dat Bui
                  <br>
                  So.
                  Once.
                  Speaking up while disadvantages, uh, what, what's the things that you find most challenging to you?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Vinh Bui
                  <br>
                  Uh, properly gain getting used to the paste out a agile up of the agile methodology. So basically we do. We do release after release project after project, so it's sometimes it's quite difficult to.
                  You will have to, uh, I guess, take a rest and a you know Caroline by as the client you know, always try to.
                  You were in the menu feature, so we have to just, you know, go along.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Dat Bui
                  <br>
                  So I I think that framework and some of the interview. So I I do have one final question.
                  Can you share an example of the world you do that best capture the essence update?
                  OK, well I meant about the access of ID industry is that you know we we are we are in the era of business for boil so they actually mentioned the I I I technology on the outdoor mention machine and cloud computing so.
                  Do you feel like your world contributing to that IT industry? And if it does, can you make an example like like a simple one?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Vinh Bui
                  <br>
                  I think, uh, basically, Long story short, but basically, uh, a device and more or less monitored, hurray.
                  Uh, we can can be brought to a next level by artificial intelligence, simply because imagine a patient was putting on his or her device and.
                  You know there's there's an event happened or take place, so and I would.
                  I would say it's only detect that event happened in in the case, if if there's a stroke or a or a or a heart attack.
                  That I guess that AI can notify the facility that was responsible for what a device that there's. There's an unusual vendor taking place between patient and required immediately respond.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Dat Bui
                  <br>
                  Or
                  alright, alright, thank you so much. I didn't come this is all and now this is end of the interview. Thank you for making time for this. Thank you.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Vinh Bui
                  <br>
                  Alright, thank you.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  Dat Bui
                  <br>
