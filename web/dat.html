                        <li>I was original from Viet Nam in which my hometown is Hue city. A bit of trivia is that although my father came from the Central – region,
                             I still have a Southern accent. I think this is because he went in the South quite a while to settle and on my mother side is originally Southern. I am addressing this since a few of my friends
                              or new acquaintances usually couldn not recognize my accent 
                             as a Southern but somewhere else like a mix accent. Aside from Vietnamese, I also know English.
                             I have an interest about technology in general that is why I chose the major in the beginning. </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            My interest in IT most I have to state that is game. 
                            Ever since I have interacted with it at a young age, I remember I was in elementary school. The game was introduced by my brother, I remember watching him play and felt it so open-mined.
                             At that time, I found it is very fascinating and every about the game is so exciting and addictive, the game calls StarCraft so after playing I was dreaming about becoming a game developer. However, on my journey of studying it,
                              I did not find making games to be as much interesting as playing them. I release I only like plying them rather than creating the game, so I changed my path to RMIT. My expectation is that I will gain a lot of knowledge and a general idea about IT.

                            The requirement for this position is knowledge in web programming in general which I’ve already known. Another skill that I do know a few about is Reactjs but I was taking like a gap year, so I have to review that one. Like I mentioned since I have already acquired the knowledge of basic web coding like HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery but still I know there will be a difficult journey for me to go.
                             Further by attending RMIT which will benefit me in web programming and acquire the knowledge for this job. The next step is to study a JavaScript framework, and I will choose Reactjs since I have quite an interest for it after coding it. Another thing is I have to make a project out of it, yes, I’m talking about building a fully function website using React framework. I think I have to first ger an internship and then working for almost a year finally I think I would
                            be able to get an interview for this. Indeed, not all of this will get me this position without an interview so I think that’s all the step I could think of. I think the description for this is quite suitable for me since I do have.

                            In this project, I will create a simple game via Unity game engine. The reason I use this project to announce a game that I created since game to me is an enjoyable and relaxing activity I often do in my free time. Although I like playing strategy or action gameplay, this one is my first simple game that I can produce. It can be played on PC or mobile and web application.
