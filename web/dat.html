                        <li>I am originally from Vietnam, and Hue is my hometown. A fun fact about me is that, despite the fact that my father is from the Central – area, I still have a Southern accent. I believe this is because he spent a long time settling in the South, and my mother is from the South. I'm addressing this since a handful of my friends or new acquaintances often mistook my accent for something different, such as a mixed accent. I am bilingual (Vietnamese and English). </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I'm fascinated by technology in general, which is why I selected this subject in the first place. I have to say that games are my main passion in IT. I've known about it since I was in elementary school and first engaged with it. The game was started by my brother. I recall watching him perform and feeling that it was a mind-opening experience. I thought it was intriguing at the time, and everything about the game was so thrilling and addicting; the game is called StarCraft, and after playing it, I dreamed of becoming a game producer. However, I did not find designing games to be as entertaining as playing them throughout my studies. I prefer to play games than create them, so I changed my major to RMIT. I anticipate gaining a great deal of information and a broad understanding of IT.

                            The requirement for this position is knowledge in web programming in general which I’ve already known. Another skill that I do know a few about is Reactjs but I was taking like a gap year, so I have to review that one. Like I mentioned since I have already acquired the knowledge of basic web coding like HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery but still I know there will be a difficult journey for me to go.
                             Further by attending RMIT which will benefit me in web programming and acquire the knowledge for this job. The next step is to study a JavaScript framework, and I will choose Reactjs since I have quite an interest for it after coding it. Another thing is I have to make a project out of it, yes, I’m talking about building a fully function website using React framework. I think I have to first ger an internship and then working for almost a year finally I think I would
                            be able to get an interview for this. Indeed, not all of this will get me this position without an interview so I think that’s all the step I could think of. I think the description for this is quite suitable for me since I do have.

                            I believe the outcome met the test's objectives. According to the 16personalities test, I am an adventurer, who revealed qualities such as open minds, a desire for new experiences, and a grounded, warm personality. In terms of the test result's impact on my behaviour, I believe it advises what I should do with my character, such as how I should behave and engage with other team members. When you're in a group, everyone has an opinion, therefore it's not a huge deal because the team is working on a common problem. and the personalities may make sharing the concept and solution difficult.
