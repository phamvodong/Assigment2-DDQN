                            <li>I am now doing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, and I like playing basketball and shooting photography in my leisure time. And the main reason I chose to spend my time in IT is that in today's world, information technology plays such an important role in our lives, affecting our daily activities in such a way that no one can ignore it. Information technology advancements, in my opinion, make a person's life better and more convenient. IT, for example, makes it simpler for individuals to weather the COVID-19 storm since they can do things online that doesn't require face-to-face interaction, such as shopping, learning, and working from home. I've had a great interest in technology since I was a youngster. When my family received their first computer, it opened up a whole new world for me, and I was able to enhance my technological expertise. It aroused my curiosity as a consequence. I competed in various tournaments and built some minor projects, such as autonomous watering systems, light bulbs, and balancing vehicles, through my high school robotics club. In addition, I've worked as a graphic designer since high school and am proficient in Python and HTML. As a result, I anticipate learning the skills required to manage an IT project and bringing my brilliant concept to life after completing my studies.</li>
